# Snake game with pseudo AI
My second project with p5.js. I created a snake game and tried to create an algorithm to beat it.
It was inspired by Code Bullet, I didnâ€™t get far but ended up with a fancy background for my portfolio.
On mouse click food is dropped on the clicked location.
On keypress ( WASD / Arrow Keys ) pseudo AI stops and you can play normally.

## Result
